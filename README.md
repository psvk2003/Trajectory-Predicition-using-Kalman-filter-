# Trajectory-Predicition-using-Kalman-filter


## Overview
This project focuses on the application of the Kalman Filter for predicting the trajectories of vehicles in various real-world scenarios. The need for accurate trajectory predictions is essential for intelligent systems, particularly in the fields of autonomous vehicles, robotics, and surveillance. The project involves simulating and studying the movement patterns of vehicles, integrating the Kalman Filter with object detection techniques. This approach not only advances understanding of fundamental filter concepts but also provides a practical, hands-on learning experience. By predicting vehicle trajectories accurately, the project aims to contribute to informed decision-making in applications such as traffic management, autonomous navigation, and surveillance systems.
